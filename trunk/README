This is the main directory of the source code of the Cloning library.

In order to create the Eclipse project, run "mvn eclipse:eclipse". You will
need Maven 2.2 or higher to run the above command. Please visit the Maven
website for detailed instructions:

http://maven.apache.org/

Once the command has been successfully executed, you may simply import the
project to your workspace, using the included launch configurations to run
some of the test suites. Alternatively, you can right-click on a test suite
or the whole project and select "Run As > JUnit Test".

Happy hacking!
